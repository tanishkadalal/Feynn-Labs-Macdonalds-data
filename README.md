Studying a small data set about macdonals reviews from a sample of population
I wanted to share about my recent Virtual internship as a Machine learning Intern at Feynn Labs under the guidance of Sanjay Basumatary.

During my internship, I collaborated with a dedicated team to delve into Real Estate price prediction in India. Our objective was 
to meticulously analyze the market and develop a robust price prediction model. Leveraging diverse machine learning algorithms, we 
integrated data from prior studies to craft a refined model. The culmination of our efforts resulted in a predictive model anchored 
in linear regression, accompanied by a comprehensive price and business model. 🏠💡

Result - Understanding segmentation analysis is pivotal in comprehending the dynamics between buyers and sellers. Our research
indicates a projected 25% surge in property prices in India by 2028, with an annual increment of 5%. Recognizing the most active 
demographic, we've identified our target audience as individuals aged 25-45. 🏡📈

Engaged in an insightful exploration of the Electric Vehicles market segmentation, where I meticulously studied industry dynamics 
and conducted comprehensive data analysis. Concurrently, I applied analytical skills to dissect McDonald's data from previous years,
aiming for strategic insights. 🚗⚡ Thriving on the intersection of innovation and data-driven decision-making.
